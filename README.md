# Daily Motivational Email Project Overview
 This project is an automated system that generates and sends daily motivational emails. It combines various APIs and data sources to create a personalized, informative, and engaging email for the recipient. The email includes motivational quotes, weather information, news updates, historical facts, and a fun GIF to start the day on a positive note.

Email Specifications
--------------------

### Subject Line

The subject line is dynamically generated each day and follows the format: "Day [X]: Your Daily Dose of Motivation and Information ðŸŒŸ" Where [X] is a counter that increments daily, tracking the recipient's journey.

### Body

The email body is divided into several sections:

1.  **Header**: Contains a personalized greeting with the recipient's name, current date, and day counter.
2.  **Weather Section**: Displays current weather information for the user's location, including temperature, description, and a weather-specific tip.
3.  **Motivational Quote**: Features an inspirational quote of the day.
4.  **AI News Grid**: Presents the latest news in three categories: Artificial Intelligence, AI Development, and Prompt Engineering.
5.  **This Day in History**: Highlights a significant historical event that occurred on this day.
6.  **Historical Events**: Lists notable births and deaths on this day in history.
7.  **Fun Fact**: Includes a random fun fact to entertain and educate the reader.
8.  **Motivational GIF**: Displays a randomly selected motivational GIF.

### Footer

The footer contains a brief message reminding the user that this email is part of their daily motivational series and encourages them to keep pushing forward.

Email Structure and Layout
--------------------------

The email uses a responsive design with a maximum width of 600px. It features a clean, modern layout with distinct sections for different types of content. The design uses the Roboto font family and a color scheme primarily based on green (#4CAF50) and white backgrounds. The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile email clients.

Tracking and Analytics
----------------------

The current implementation does not include specific tracking or analytics. However, the incremental day counter provides a basic form of engagement tracking.

Personalization and Dynamic Content
-----------------------------------

1.  User's name in the greeting
2.  Day counter for personalized journey tracking
3.  Location-based weather information
4.  Daily-changing content (quote, news, historical facts, fun fact, GIF)

Project Structure
-----------------

-   main.py: Main script for generating and sending the email
-   send_email.py: Module for handling email sending functionality
-   email_template.html: HTML template for the email structure
-   email_style.css: CSS styles for email formatting
-   counter.txt: Stores the current day count
-   .env: Contains environment variables (API keys, email credentials, etc.)

Setup and Usage
---------------
